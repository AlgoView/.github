This is a project for and by algorithmic trading enthousiasts that aim to take their creativity to the next level by unlocking python and AI on the well known Tradingview charts.

We do this as much of the work in building good algorithms is done with good analyses, and visualisation. Seeing more quicker, speeds up the process of this type of coding.

This project is Opensource and open for people to join at all times
