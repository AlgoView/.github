# ![The Algoview Project](https://github.com/AlgoView/.github/blob/main/resources/AV-PROJECT_banner.jpg)

## Introduction
This is a project for and by algorithmic trading enthousiasts and quantitative analysts that aim to take their creativity to the next level.<br>
On robust systems we aim to create an easy to use environment using the well known ```Tradingview charts```.

Much of the work in building algorithms is done with visual analyses, this requires quick visualisation of intensive computations.<br>
Calculations that are done faster, speeds up the process of this type of developing, and broadens the capabilities of the developer.

Rendering algorithms and storing market data on self-deployed systems, giving its owner control and capabilities in automation beyond conventional software currently available is the aim of this project.<br>

<br>
This project is <b>Opensource</b> and open for people to join at all times.

## Get Involved
Right now, AlgoView is in its starting phase, and there will be excellent "good first issue" opportunities,<br>
We aim to create a community of developers that can help each other and share their knowledge and experience.<br>
if you're looking to get involved, join us on discord, or contact the administrators to get started.
