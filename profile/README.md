## Introduction

Welcome to the **AlgoView Project**, an ambitious initiative crafted by and for algorithmic trading enthusiasts and quantitative analysts who aspire to elevate their creativity and expertise to new heights. Our mission is to develop a robust, user-friendly environment that empowers users to build, analyze, and deploy sophisticated trading algorithms with unparalleled efficiency.

We firmly believe that the cornerstone of successful algorithmic trading lies in meticulous analysis and insightful visualization. By streamlining calculations and enhancing computational speed, we aim to accelerate the development process, enabling traders and analysts to iterate rapidly and refine their strategies with ease.

As an **open-source** project, AlgoView thrives on collaboration and community engagement. We warmly invite contributors from all backgrounds to join us at any time. Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible in algorithmic trading.

## Get Involved

AlgoView is currently in its foundational phase, presenting an excellent opportunity for passionate individuals to make a significant impact from the outset. We have a variety of "good first issue" tasks that are perfect for newcomers eager to dive in and seasoned developers looking to share their expertise.

## Main Objectives

Our project is structured around four core objectives, each integral to building a comprehensive and versatile platform:

### [Aggregate `Market and Chain Data`](https://github.com/AlgoView/.github/blob/main/project/AV-AGGREGATE.md)

- **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Go beyond traditional Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV) data by aggregating extensive market and blockchain (chain) data, including order book depth, transaction history, and on-chain metrics.
- **Derivative Creation:** Develop and store useful derivatives and technical indicators that provide deeper insights into market dynamics, enhancing analytical capabilities for users.

### [Simulate `Backtesting, Projection Testing, Analytical Tools`](https://github.com/AlgoView/.github/blob/main/project/AV-SIMULATE.md)

- **Advanced Scripting with Python:** Offer unlimited scripting capabilities using Python, allowing users to create, test, and optimize their own algorithms within a flexible environment.
- **Automated Adaptation & Fitting:** Implement tools for automated parameter tuning and strategy fitting to adapt to evolving market conditions.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Leverage machine learning techniques to enhance predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and strategy optimization.
- **Comprehensive Analytical Tools:** Provide a suite of analytical tools for in-depth backtesting, projection testing, and performance evaluation.

### [Automate `Exchange Connection with Portfolio Management Tools`](https://github.com/AlgoView/.github/blob/main/project/AV-AUTOMATE.md)

- **Secure Exchange Connectivity:** Establish a secure, two-way connection with multiple exchanges, enabling real-time data access and trade execution.
- **Automated & Manual Portfolio Management:** Equip users with tools to manage portfolios efficiently, including automated rebalancing, risk assessment, and manual adjustments.

### [Visualize `User Interface and Controller`](https://github.com/AlgoView/.github/blob/main/project/AV-VISUALIZE.md)

- **Interactive Data Visualization:** Create dynamic charts and dashboards to visualize market data, chain data, and analytical results, enhancing decision-making processes.
- **Automation Tools Interface:**
  - **Algorithm Deployment:** Allow users to apply algorithms to trading pairs directly from the interface.
  - **Portfolio Algorithms:** Enable the application of algorithms for portfolio management and optimization.
- **Manual Trading Tools:** Provide an intuitive interface for manual trading, complete with order management and execution functionalities.
- **Server Status Monitoring:** Include real-time monitoring tools to track server performance and system health.

**The main tasks have been divided into four servers for the following reasons:**

> **Structure:** Enhances project organization and simplifies version control by compartmentalizing different components.
>
> **Security:** Improves security by isolating tasks and using APIs for communication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
>
> **Stability:** Facilitates fault isolation, allowing individual components to be updated or reverted without impacting the entire system.
>
> **Flexibility:** Empowers users to deploy servers in environments that best suit their needs, whether at home or on dedicated services, based on requirements like uptime, connection speed, computational capability, and security.

## Roadmap

To kickstart the project, our initial focus will be on **AV-Visualize** and **AV-Aggregate**, as they form the foundation upon which **AV-Automate** and **AV-Simulate** will build. We will utilize TradingView charts initially, transitioning to a custom charting module as the project evolves.

Our approach involves first developing manual trading tools within **AV-Visualize** that interact with **AV-Automate** to execute trades on users' accounts via APIs.

### Phase 0: Initial Setup and Data Aggregation

**AV-Aggregate** and **AV-Visualize**

- **Market Data Integration:** Establish connections with various exchanges to collect real-time and historical market data.
- **Basic Visualization:** Implement initial charting capabilities using third-party tools like TradingView to display market data.
- **User Interface Development:** Begin crafting a user-friendly interface focusing on accessibility and ease of navigation.

### Phase 1: Enhanced Custom Data Charting

**AV-Aggregate** and **AV-Visualize**

- **Custom Charting Module Development:** Create a bespoke charting tool tailored to our specific requirements, moving beyond third-party solutions.
- **Advanced Data Visualization:** Introduce complex chart types, technical indicators, and customizable visual elements.
- **Performance Optimization:** Enhance data processing speeds to provide real-time updates and smooth user experiences.

### Phase 2: Manual Trading Tool Implementation

**AV-Aggregate**

- **User Data Integration:** Fetch and store current and historical orders, trades, and positions from users' exchange accounts via **AV-Automate**.
- **Portfolio Data Management:** Maintain detailed records of portfolio balances, transaction fees, and profit/loss statements.
