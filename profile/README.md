# ![The Algoview Project](https://github.com/AlgoView/.github/blob/main/resources/AV-PROJECT_banner.jpg)

## Introduction
This is a project for and by algorithmic trading enthousiasts and quantitative analysts that aim to take their creativity to the next level.<br>
On robust systems we aim to create an easy to use environment usings the well known **Tradingview charts**.

Much of the work in building good algorithms is done with visual analyses, this requires quick visualisation of algorithms with heavy calculations.<br>
Calculations that are done faster, speeds up the process of this type of developing, and broadens the capabilities of the developer.

This project is **Opensource** and open for people to join at all times

## Get Involved
Right now, AlgoView is in its starting phase, and there will be excellent "good first issue" opportunities,<br>
if you're looking to get involved, join us on discord, or contact the administrators to get started.
